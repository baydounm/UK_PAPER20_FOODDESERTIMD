Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) datasets are small area measures of relative deprivation across each of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. Areas are ranked from the most deprived area (rank 1) to the least deprived area. Each nation publishes its data on its own data portal. Each nation measures deprivation in a slightly different way but the broad themes include income, employment, education, health, crime, barriers to housing and services, and the living environment.

Content
CDRC has collected the datasets together and republished them here. The republished files are separate English, Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish IMD data, calculated for different years. The statistical unit areas used to provide indices of relative deprivation across the country are Lower layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) [England, Wales], Data Zones [Scotland] and Super Output Areas or Wards [Northern Ireland].

We also provide a number of value added versions, including a consolidated "Harmonised" version which combines the four nations together (without reweighting), and a rebased English IMD just for London - the CDRC London IMD 2019 (English IMD 2019 Domains rebased). This re-ranks the English IMD for just the LSOAs in London, and splits these into deciles. The attributes used in the ranking remain unchanged. The English IMD 2019 rebased version of the file is mapped on on Trust for London's London Poverty Profile. The Index has been published by CDRC only and is not an official government statistic.

Many of the IMD datasets included here have been mapped on CDRC Mapmaker, included the Harmonised version shown in the embedded map on this page.

The related links section below includes a number of additional resources such as published papers that use the CDRC Harmonised Index.

Quality, Completeness and Bias
As official government statistics, the quality of the indices is believed to be very high, and complete - covering every small statistical unit area of the United Kingdom at regular intervals. Each home nation tunes its version of the index to meet local needs, resulting in different emphasises (and so biases) for each nation.

Dataset1_CDRC_Harmonised_IMD2019:

Simple (non-reweighted) combination of the English IMD 2019, Welsh IMD 2019, Northern Irish MDM 2017 and the Scottish IMD 2020 deciles. For each country, 10% of areas fall in each decile. Each country's IMD is calculated according to slightly different criteria, and ranked within the country only, so deciles cannot be compared between countries. The shortcomings of this approach are acknowledged, nevertheless the approximation is still useful for some other CDRC products which use it, e.g. handling cross-border moves in CDRC Residential Mobility and Deprivation (RMD). Local authority districts are LAD19CD.
